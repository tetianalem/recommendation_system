The set of research presents an original recommendation system that delivers suggestions based on content and collaborative techniques, addressing major issues in this field. The focus of the paper is hybrid recommendation systems in e-commerce markets with a low level of implementing recommendation system techniques. The market of recommendation systems in Ukraine and its main features are analyzed. A methodology for developing hybrid recommendation systems relevant to the needs of the Ukrainian e-commerce market is proposed.

The hybrid recommendation system encompasses recommendation systems in four categories: Personalized recommendation, Best buy, News, and Recommendation according to the survey. An alternative approach to product evaluation in the proposed recommendation systems, based on a combination of Wilson, Bayes, and Hacker methods, is utilized. It is demonstrated that this approach can be successful for recommendation systems in Ukraine. The utility of the concept for users lies in the creation of more customized recommendations that are more attractive to them, considering a broader set of variables such as the time of publishing, the percentage of favorable comments, and personal preferences.
